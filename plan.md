# Plan

* Exploring the application of rewrite strategies in Lift optimised for Image processing
* Euan McGrevey
* 2255355
* Michel Steuwer

Week-by-week plan for the whole project.

## Winter semester

* **Week 1**
* **Week 2**
* **Week 3**
* **Week 4**
 - Write first bit of Lift, looking at nearest neighbour image upscaling
 - Look at Halide for inspiration steps in pipeline I can look to implement as well

* **Week 5**
 - Rewrite naive nearest neigbour implementation to use Lift primitives

* **Week 6**
 - As unable to write naive NN functionally, write much simpler version of algorithm in raw scala without Lift primitives.
 - Looking to the future, have a look at how Tomas (PHD student) has used Elevate to encode the application of rewrite rules for image blurring
 - Have another look at other image processing pipelines to write next

* **Week 7**
* **Week 8**
* **Week 9**
* **Week 10**
* **Week 11 [PROJECT WEEK]**
* **Week 12 [PROJECT WEEK]** Status report submitted.
