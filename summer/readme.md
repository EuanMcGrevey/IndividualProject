# Summer work

* Exploring the application of rewrite strategies in Lift optimised for Image processing
* Euan McGrevey
* 2255355
* Michel Steuwer


## Research completed

Read first two chapters of Steuwer 2015 thesis which introduces:
The design philosophy behind CPU and GPU architecture;
Challenges of programmability and performance portability faced by developers creating software for these modern parallel processors;
and motivates the need for an alternative approach which can address these issues.


## Ideas developed

Potential particular image processing applications for which I could explore the application of rewrite rules with the aim of generating optimised code, e.g. converting bitmap to svg (vectorisation of image), blurring, convolutions.


## Concerns or risks identified

Never done research before; potentially way out of my depth.
